# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
## Iâ€™m @masprast
I'm a freelance software developer who has specialties as **Backend Dev**, **Flutter** and **Linux system administration**. I have curiousity and passion in programming and _linux system administration_ and wants to create a system or software that usefull to users.

## About me
A brief about my experience, I have been to college for bachelor degree on Computer Science discipline at 2012, but life's changing, so I decided to drop out at 2021 and focused on work. Ever since that I still study to growth my programming skill. I used to be a worker at cattle food factory twice in 2010-2011 (different company) before being a vocational teacher at K12 education level (teaching at SMK, TKJ discipline), which is my last job, for **7 years** (started at 2015) teaching _Linux server administration_ and _computer networks_ mostly but with little programming fundamental with **Python**. Then I quit my job as a teacher in February 2023 and become a software developer freelance to this day.

## Motto
- If you have a knowledge, share it, event its a little
- If you can't afford it, **don't pirate!** Use (free or cheaper) alternatives until you can afford it.
- Treat others as you would like to be treated

## Interest
- I have interest in problem solving or brainstorming, because I like to think hard and deep.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Education, because I used to be a teacher at vocational school, who teach mostly linux server administration and computer network.
- Also I love art, photography, and drawing, because I used to draw when I was a kid and cut off my drawing to use it as a moveable toys back then.
- I keep learning programming and other tech stuff so that my skill growth.
- Somewhat I'm interested in architecture and wood working. Yes I do.

## Skill set
- I'm quiet skillfull at **Linux system administration**, I believe I'm at intermediate level at least.
- I'm quite experianced using **Docker** and have deployed an API mock to **GCP (Google App Engine)**, **Heroku** (deleted by Heroku because of unpayed invoice ðŸ˜…, I though it's free) and **AWS (currently learning)**.
- I also quiet experienced in **Dart** programming language using **Flutter** framework, since 2019 using it to develop an app for school (where I'm work at)
- Can code vanilla backend with **JS/TS (prefer TS)** with **NodeJS**, but quiet understand by using a framework like **NestJS**
- Like TS, I also can code using **Python** and have experience with **Django and FastAPI**
- I do can code in **Shell** although not at master level, because its MANDATORY in using linux.
- I can construct a **Dockerfile**, but often use **docker-compose** for easy development (eventhough sometimes it can be complex)
- ðŸŒ± I have learned **Ruby on Rails**, but for a short time.
- Currently I learn about **CI/CD**, to support my devops skill

## Project
- I have done a project for mobile application using Flutter ðŸ“± (WIP), although I'm not going to release it on PlayStore because it's going to be use internally for my client foundation (Indonesian: yayasan).
- A backend using **NodeJS & MongoDB** which deployed at **AWS** for the above project.
