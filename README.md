# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
## Iâ€™m @masprast
I'm a freelance software developer who want to be a DevOps, because I have curiousity in linux system administration.

## About me
A brief about my experience, I have been to college for bachelor degree on Computer Science discipline at 2012, but life's changing, so I decided to drop out at 2021. Ever since that I still study to increasing my programming skill. I used to be a worker at cattle food factory twice in 2010-2011, before being a vocational teacher (teaching at SMK, TKJ discipline), which is my last job, for 7 years (started at 2015). Then I quit my job as a teacher in February 2023 and become a software developer freelance until now.

## Motto
- If you have a knowledge, share it, event its a little
- If you can't afford it, don't pirate! Use (free or cheaper) alternatives until you can afford it.
- Treat others as you would like to be treated

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Education, because I used to be a teacher at vocational school, who teach mostly linux server administration and computer network.
- I keep learning programming and other tech stuff so that my skill growth.
- Somewhat I'm interested in architecture and wood working. Yes I do.
